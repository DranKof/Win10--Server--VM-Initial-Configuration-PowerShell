# Win10, Server, VM Initial Configuration PowerShell
 Config everything automatically and saves hours of time

Simply select the ps1 files most related to what you're doing and then execute it after initial Windows install completes.

Want to customize it?
  - It's super easy! No functions, no questions, just comment-uncomment.
  - Also, there's a link in each file to the source of where I got all the scripts from if any customizations are missing.

# How to install the fastest
 1) Open PowerShell as Administrator!
2) ...Then open this page in web browser or open a copy of ps1 in notepad.
3) Copy, Paste into Powershell.
You're done.

"Why not just execute the ps1 script?"
  - You'd either have to reduce computer security and/or browse to the right folder or type commands and it just becomes a layered mess.
